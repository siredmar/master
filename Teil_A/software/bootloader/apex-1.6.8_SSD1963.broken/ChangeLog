2009-01-23  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): v1.6.8

2009-01-23  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c (target_init): Added code to the
	target initialization for Companion that initializes the modem.

2009-01-21  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): v1.6.7 for push of new features.

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-mmc.c (mmc_report): Revised reporting to make
	it easier to troubleshoot cards.

2009-01-20  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* include/mmc.h (mmc_card_acquired): Revised the card acquisition
	code so that we don't assume that the first byte of the CID
	register is non-zero.  IMHO, our assumption was correct based on
	the SD association's documentation, but we found that the Eye-FI
	card has a bogus looking card ID (CID) register and we have to be
	lenient to see it.

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): v1.6.6 for Companion fixes so it can use a
	1.6.x version of APEX.

	* src/drivers/relocate-nand.c: Revised NAND relocator to work with
	the LPD7A404.  Considering that the only other user of the code is
	a test implemented for the LH79524, this should be safe to
	rework.  The key difference is that the relocator will address
	each page in turn instead of depending on an unreliable feature of
	NAND flash that automatically loads successive sectors.   

	* src/arch-arm/Kconfig: Changed the Companion bootstrap to use the
	NAND relocator.  This allows us to have a loader that is larger
	than 80KiB, the size of SRAM.
	Added a page size configuration option for relocation from NAND
	flash.

	* src/apex/cmd-version.c (cmd_version): Fixed display of
	environment variables s.t. the >64KiB length is properly shown in
	the version command output.

2009-01-11  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-image.c (cmd_image): Added an option to relocate
	the ramdisk image s.t. the uBoot image format can be loaded with
	"image load" and then used to boot the system.

2009-01-05  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-orion5x/mv2120_config: Moving to the CodeSourcery
	compiler for thumb support.

	* src/arch-arm/lib/cp15-invalidate-dcache-va.c
	(invalidate_dcache_va): Conditionally compiling the
	invalidate-dcache-va function based on the presence of the macro
	and, therefore, the CP15 feature.

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): 1.6.5 for orion5x merge.

2009-01-04  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-flashusage.c (cmd_flashusage): New command to scan
	eraseblocks of a flash device for the presence of data.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/memory.h (RAM_BANK0_LENGTH): Fixed the
	declarations of the extents for the memory regions in the
	LH7952x.  The macros were correct for the LH79524 but not the
	LH79520.  This is now fixed.

	* src/drivers/drv-ext2.c (ext2_identify): Revised EXT2 driver to
	look for extended partitions and to cope with 64 bit IO.

	* include/driver.h: Support for 64 bit IO sizes.  This is only
	necessary for large devices like those accessible via ATA/SATA.
	It is optional and somewhat expensive.  Even the EXT2 driver will
	function without it, but it won't be able to see partitions past
	2GiB.  This change trickled into lots of areas of APEX because of
	the change of types in the descriptor structure.  However, there
	should be no size or performance impact when the system is
	compiled without CONFIG_DRIVER_LONG_LONG_SIZE.

	* src/arch-arm/lib/muldi3.S: Inclusion of another kernel function
	for handling aeabi entry points.  This was required by drv-ata
	when we compiled it with THUMB.

	* src/arch-arm/lib/cp15-wait.c: This and other cp15 functions so
	that cp15 operations can be invoked from THUMB code without THUMB2
	support and without specialized code to detect the operation
	mode.  These functions allow all code that lacks __asm's to be
	compiled with THUMB.
	
2008-12-30  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-fat.c (fat_open):  Adding greater specificity
	to the region construction from the block_driver().

	* src/drivers/drv-ext2.c (ext2_open): Adding greater specificity
	to the region construction from the block_driver().

	* src/drivers/driver.c (parse_descriptor): Fix to disambiguate
	regions that could have path elements.  The parser would not
	interpret driver:10k as having a start address of 10k when the
	driver could accept a path.  Now, parser will interpret driver:bin
	as having a path of 'bin', but driver:10k as having a starting
	offset as 10k.  The region can be unambiguously constructed using
	'@' and '/' appropriately.
 
2008-12-22  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/mach-mx3/drv-i2c.c: New I2C driver for MX3x.  Not complete,
	but working for writes to the I2C#1 controller.

	* src/mach-mx3/cmd-wm8955.c: New command for sending control
	messages to the WM8955L on the PSJL Karma.

2008-12-21  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/driver.c (parse_descriptor): Fix for the parsing of
	FS descriptors such that the start address and length parameters
	may be set.
	(parse_descriptor): Added the '%' special character for combining
	one or more descriptors.  This is used by the drivers that have a
	basis driver defined in an environment variable, s.t. the driver
	can specify a starting address and/or length without knowing the
	exact form specified by the 

2008-12-18  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): Rolling revision for PSJL implementation. 1.6.4.

2008-12-14  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c (nor_probe_chip): Support for broken
	AMD/Spansion NOR flash that does not properly report top-boot
	vs. bottom-boot.
	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c: In order to support the Micronix
	(Spansion compatible) NOR flash in the HP MediaVault 2120, we
	needed to completely fill out the Spansion support.  There is
	support for a single byte wide bus and a 16 bit internal logic as
	is the case on the MV2120.

2008-12-13  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c (ReadArray): Changed the ReadArray
	command for Spansion to 0xf0.
2008-12-11  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/arch-arm/lib/cp15.c (cp15_ctrl): Enhanced the cp15 report on
	the control register to be more readable and to show more
	bits (ARMv6).

2008-11-25  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-image.c (cmd_image): Adding descriptor_open() call
	to image load so that we can read from tftp.

2008-11-20  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c (nor_report): Cleanup of the nor flash
	driver report.  Added start address and length that match the mem
	driver.

2008-11-19  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* Makefile: Thumb support restored, required a little work to the
	src/arch-arm/lib code to guarantee interwork compatibility.

	* src/mach-mx3/exception_vectors.c: Implementation of exception
	vectors on MX31, primarily in support of debugging THUMB.

	* src/arch-arm/lib/div64.S: Slight recoding of platform
	implementations of basic functions to be interwork compatible.

2008-11-18  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/net/tftp.c (tftp_receiver): Reporting on TFTP errors
	s.t. we properly detect file-not-found problems.

2008-11-13  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): Version 1.6.3 for dm9000.  The initial
          orion patches are in as well, but not yet supported.

	* src/drivers/drv-dm9000.c (dm9000_read): Implementation of
	dm9000_{read,write} to round out support for dm9000 as a complete
	Ethernet MAC/PHY driver.

2008-09-16  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/lib/strtol.c: Adding strtol as a separate library function,
	in case it is needed.  The memlimit command will use this function.

	* src/mach-mx3/rosencrantz.h (CCM_PDR0_V): Override for the PDR0
	so that the CSI clock scalar is non-default.

	* src/mach-mx3/mx31.h (CCM_UPCTL_266_V): Fixed the UPCTL
	initialization values.  This PLL is based on the CKIH, so it
	doesn't need to change when the CPU clock speed changes.
	(CCM_PDR0_V): Allowing this value to be overridden by the board
	specific header.

	* src/drivers/drv-mem.c (cmd_memlimit): Revised memlimit to permit
	a negative offset which is then subtracted from the total system
	memory.

2008-09-15  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* debian/rules (binary-arch): Adding apex-image to the tools
	installed in the debian package.

2008-09-12  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-image-uboot.c: Documentation for UBOOT image
	format.
	(verify_uboot_image): Added support for multi-images.  Now loading
	UBOOT images the same way that UBOOT does.

	* src/apex/region-checksum.c (region_checksum): Fixed the checksum
	to account for incoming CRC value as is necessary for UBOOT image
	CRC computation.

	* src/apex/cmd-image-uboot.c: Added uboot image support.  No
	multi-images, but the rest works OK.

	* src/apex/region-checksum.c (region_checksum): Added neglected
	check for whether or not the caller wants the length added to the
	checksum

	* src/apex/cmd-image-apex.c (handle_apex_image): Factored out the
	APEX image code so we can implement UBOOT in separate file with
	optional compilation.

2008-09-11  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* scripts/Makefile.build (modorder-target): Removed build of the
	module.order files.

	* src/apex/cmd-copy.c (cmd_copy): Fixed the return value so copy
	doesn't stop startup.

	* src/apex/cmd-image.c (handle_load_apex_image): Cleaned up the
	output and make the check and load functions look similar in
	output.

	* src/apex/region-checksum.c (region_checksum): Fixed checksumming
	so that we can sum over a defined range instead of being limited
	to summing the whole region.

2008-09-10  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-image.c (apex_image): Refactored cmd-image code to
	support a single driver for parsing through the header data.
	
2008-09-10  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-image.c (cmd_image): Fixed cascade testing of
	options.

	* src/lib/gmtime.c (gmtime_r): Fixed year calc (typo).
	(gmtime_r): Fixed month calc, off by one.
	(convert_two_digits): Fixed representation of numbers; digits
	swapped.

	* src/lib/strimatch.c (strimatch): Fixed this function to properly
	match when the case is identical.

2008-08-28  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-help.c (compare_commands): Righted command sort
	order.
	(cmd_help): Eliminated a possible overflow of command listing
	array.

2008-08-27  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-mem.c (memory_write): Fixed un-aligned write
	code.  The original test used were allowing invalid unaligned
	accesses.

2008-08-26  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/mach-mx3/nor-cfi.h: Removed bogus override of the NOR flash
	memory command type.

	* src/mach-mx3/initialize.c (target_init): New initialization of
	the DM9000 memory region for MX31.  The timing is much tighter and
	the OE and R_Wn timing has a better guarantee of accuracy.

	* src/drivers/drv-dm9000.c (cmd_eth): New 'r' and 'w' subcommands
	for inspecting registers of the DM9000.  Renamed the 're' command
	to eeprom since that's what it does.

	* src/apex/services.c (init_services): More clear output from
	service startup in LL mode.

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): New version for changes to DM9000 code and
	for new KarmaV configuration.

2008-07-09  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-ext2.c: Added support for the inode_size field
	in the first revision of the second-extended filesystem's
	superblock.

2008-05-20  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* debian/postinst: Fixed the postinst script to only run on the
	NSLU2.

2007-10-16  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* Makefile: The help make target now shows the configurations and
	the descriptions of them.
	(SUBLEVEL): 1.5.13.

	* src/drivers/relocate-nand.c: Fixed the basic NAND relocator.
	The code was previously broken as there was no configuration that
	used it.
 
	* src/drivers-lh/Kconfig: Added 565 option for LCD panel.  Odd,
	that we'd never implemented this before, but it is important to
	note that the NXP LCD controller doesn't cope with 565 as well as
	555.

	* src/mach-mx3/ipu.c: Inverted sense of LED outputs for testing
	Rosencrantz.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/clcdc-karma.c: Added adapter code for Karam LCD
	panel.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/cmd-karmaaccel.c: Added accelerometer test code
	for Karma.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/cmd-karmatouch.c: Added touch controller test
	code for Karma.

	* Removed a lot of cruft associated with older NAND flash
	implementations.  NAND code is moved to the drivers directory.

2007-08-06  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): Rolling to 1.5.11 just to make sure we got
	all of the timing parameter changes in a unique version.

2007-07-24  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): rolling to 1.5.10 for fix to CPU timing on
	lh7a404.

2007-07-24  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c: Moved the clock speed setup to
	the early initialization routine so that it is properly
	configured.

2007-06-27  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* usr/apex-env.cc (arg_parser): Added force option to the apex-env
	command.
	(main): Added partial command support so that 'apex-env rel' shows
	the release version.

2007-06-26  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: Removed Companion section from
	the general build.

2007-06-25  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): 1.5.8: Releasing for Debian package.
	
	* usr/apex-env.cc: Added release and region commands for probing
	the APEX environment.

	* src/apex/env.c: Added prefix option to the startup command.
	Removed crufty old ENV_STARTUP option that was mach specific.

2007-06-03  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: Renamed some of the sections to
	make the meanings clear.  Preemtively fixed a vulnerability to
	section reordering.  Fixed the setting of fSDRAMBoot so that it
	works for INLINE init mode and for the older form.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/initialize.c (bootstrap_sdram_pre): Revamped the
	initialization code for ixp42x to use inline mode.  Took the
	opportunity to elide a lot of cruft from the routines.  It isn't
	yet tested as written to flash as this requires setup of one of
	the wigglers.  None of the typical uses of APEX on the ixp42x
	install APEX as the primary boot loader, so this can wait.

	* src/arch-arm/Kconfig: Configuration option to override the
	default SDRAM execution detection code.  Most platforms can use
	the execution address to detect whether or not APEX is running in
	SDRAM.  Some, like the ixp42x map flash over SDRAM, so we have to
	use a custom piece of code to detect this circumstance.
  
2007-06-03  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/Kconfig: Added AEABI configuration option so that
	we can link APEX with an AEABI toolchain.  Really, the only
	difference is the inclusion of a couple of math functions.

	* src/arch-arm/lib/lib1funcs.S: Added config.h to build of
	lib1funcs so that the configuration dependencies are checked.

2007-06-02  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): 1.5.6: Releasing version with fix section
	ordering.

2007-06-01  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/reset.c: Fixed a problem in the ordering of
	the reset sections that was illuminated by rwhitby's default
	compiler.

2007-06-01  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): 1.5.5 for the SAVEATONCE option, very
	necessary for OneNAND stored environment. 

	* src/lib/env.c: New option, CONFIG_ENV_SAVEATONCE implements a
	cached environment that is saved at one time to non-volatile
	storage instead of through incremental updates.  This is necessary
	for some types of NAND flash where multiple writes to the same
	page are limited.

	* src/apex/*.c: Groomed error reporting for opening regions.

	* src/lib/env.c: Changed the environment region descriptor name to
	d_env so that it is easier to remember.

2007-05-30  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): 1.5.4.  Rolling revision for the sake of
	the xscale fixes.

	* src/mach-mx3/cmd-sleep.c (cmd_sleep): Test code for MX31 sleep
	modes.

	* src/mach-mx3/cmd-reset.c (cmd_reset): Command verified.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/reset.c: Added a jump to reset_exit() from
	reset() in the event that we disable the MMU at startup.  The
	ixp42x needs this because the xscale MMU flush code allocates data
	in the text section.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/initialize-sdram.c (cmd_initialize_sdram): Fixed
	the scan of 256Mib SDRAM chips.  A small change to the algorithm
	and we seem to be able to detect 64MiB of memory just fine.

	* src/drivers/drv-mem.c (cmd_memscan): Error detection for region
	too small.

2007-05-24  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/driver.c (parse_descriptor): Unparseable regions
	will now generate an error.

	* src/apex/cmd-version.c (cmd_version): Added a message about the
	currently set variation.

2007-05-24  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): 1.5.3.  Rolling rev for the sake of working
	IPU code, working sensor capture, and turing off of the
	illumination LEDs.

	* src/mach-mx3/ipu.c (cmd_ipu): Fixed the shutter width to
	increase frame rate.

	* src/mach-mx3/ipu.c (ipu_setup): Fixed the burst width to memory
	through the IPU DMAC.

2007-05-22  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-dm9000.c: Fixed failed probe code path.  If the
	dm9000 isn't found, there will be no report.

	* src/mach-mx3/ipu.c: Adding view finder DMA task.

	* src/lib/env.c (env_check_magic): Fixed empty/broken environment
	region case.

2007-05-18  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* Makefile (ARCH): Releasing 1.5.2.

	* src/arch-arm/Kconfig: Fixed companion boot by explicitly
	enabling the simple/NOR flash relocator as the primary relocator.

	* src/drivers/drv-nand.c (nand_sequential_input): Fixed the NAND
	driver to R/W on ST NAND parts.

2007-05-17  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/mach-lh7952x/debug_ll.h: Fixed UART declarations.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/init-motoedge.c: Converted to inline
	platform initialization.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/relocate-simple.c: fixed relocate-simple()
	because we changed the way we handle offsets.

2007-05-16  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): Rolled to 1.5.2 so that we can keep track
	of this interim release.

	* src/apex/command.c (exec_monitor): Eliminated representation of
	empty commands in startup command list.

2007-05-15  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: Reorganized the sections and the
	section names to be more readable and consistent.

2007-05-12  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/reset.c: Restructured to allow for cleaner
	startup code.  Legacy implementations are still OK, but the new
	plumbing permits seamless transitions between various
	initialization elements to handle constrained boot situations.
	Also removed an onerous constraint on register usage in the
	relocate_apex() function.  The caller is now forced to assume that
	no registers are saved.

	* src/arch-arm/linux/atag.c (atag_header): Eliminated the core tag.

2007-05-10  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Releasing 1.5.0 with iMX31 and OneNAND.

2007-05-10  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/drivers/relocate-onenand.c: Groomed the relocation for
	OneNAND to remove unneeded return address calculation.

	* src/drivers/drv-dm9000.c: Added code to help select the proper
	default interface when there could be two and only one is present.

	* src/mach-mx3/initialize.c: Groomed the startup code to remove
	much cruft.

	* src/apex/env.c: Fixed typo in the default environment startup
	command that was including the ramdisk startup even though there
	was none needed.

2007-05-10  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/apex/command.c (call_command): Reorganized command
	invocation to report bogus command requests.

2007-05-09  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: Start of reorganization of the
	bootstrap so that we don't need to use function calls to handle
	early setup *and* we don't depend on macros.

2007-05-07  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/drivers/relocate-onenand.c: Implementation of OneNAND
	APEX relocation for bootstrap.

	* src/apex/env.c: Improved the environment link so that it can
	exist even if there is no user-modifiable environment.  This is to
	allow user-land to browse environment variables even if they
	cannot set them.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/preinitialization-companion.c: Comment on
	preinitialization.

2007-05-04  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/mach-mx3/ipu.c (cmd_ipu): Fixed the i2c code and added hooks
	to enable camera test patterns.

	* src/mach-mx3/initialize.c: Substantially enhanced the system
	setup.  The IPU test code is now able to write to memory.

	* src/apex/cmd-version.c (cmd_version): Added target board
	description string.

2007-04-30  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/mach-mx3/initialize.c: Extra check in the initialization
	routine so that we don't alter the timing registers if the CPU is
	already in the target mode.  It looks like the CPU doesn't like
	the PLLs being changed once it has booted.  It may be the SDRAM
	that doesn't like the timing change.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/reset.c: Restored setting of the CPSR mode in
	the loader.  The CPU boots in the undefined mode.  We move to
	supervisor mode, though this doesn't appear to be necessary for
	the kernel to boot.

	* src/mach-mx3/ipu.c (ipu_report): Improved clarity of IPU report
	to break out fields and to describe the formats in English.

2007-04-27  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* include/asm/cp15-armv6.h: Fixed the cache control macros for the
	ARMV6.

2007-04-27  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/mach-mx3/ipu.c: More IPU debug code.  The report function
	has a clean rendering of the registers.

	* src/mach-mx3/mx31.h (CCM_PDR0_533_V): Switched to 533MHz CPU
	clock.

	* src/mach-mx3/uart.h (INITIALIZE_CONSOLE_UART): extended the
	FIFOS to 16 bytes.

	* src/mach-mx3/initialize.c: Added initialization of COSR even
	though we don't use it.

	* src/mach-mx3/Kconfig: New architecture number for Rosencrantz.

2007-04-24  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/apex/services.c: Created this file to hold service
	init/release code.

	* src/apex/env.c: Added a "" to the startup command so that we can
	have an empty startup command.

2007-04-09  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* 1.4.18 for mx31 changes.

2007-04-06  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-mem.c (memory_read): Fixed the memory read
	function so that it properly reads from word width regions.

	* src/mach-mx3/initialize.c: Fixed the usleep timer programming.
	There were two problems.  First, the base frequency is not as
	advertized.  The CPU can only use the IPG clock as the basis.
	Second, our programming of the timer was wrong and needed to be
	reworked so that we properly detected the timer expiration.
	(__section): Added DM9000 region initialization.

2007-03-01  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-mem.c (memory_write): Revised the drv-mem write
	function so that it does it's best to match the requested IO width
	when we're writing from the fill command.  Other users should be
	unaffected.

2007-02-25  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* 1.4.17

	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c (nor_read): Fixed the nor-cfi driver
	cache support.  It wasn't properly purging cache entries so the
	write and erase code was failing.  Now, we invalidate entries for
	the area we've read.  We still see the significant improvement in
	read throughput.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/mmu.c: Added comment about how it is the
	called who must purge the cache on marking a block uncacheable.
	This also removes a bit of code that did nothing.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/initialize-sdram.c (cmd_initialize_sdram): SDRAM
	initialization code for the ixp42x so that we can initialize SDRAM
	even though we're not the primary boot loader.  It *looks* OK, but
	I haven't been able to test it with multi-chip slugs.

2007-02-15  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-nand.c: Revised the NAND flash initialization
	code to allow for better/more flexible detection of NAND chip
	organizations.  Without a comprehensive directory of chip IDs,
	we're looking for an easy way represent the ID->organization
	mapping.

2007-02-14  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): 1.4.16.  Rev for fat-slug support.

	* src/drivers/drv-mem.c (memory_scan): Fixed error in memory scan
	that wasn't accoounting for the last block in a region.  This
	probably would never have been a problem, but was noticed while
	testing the memscan function.
	(cmd_memscan): New command that scans a region of memory as if
	we're scanning memory when APEX starts.  This is useful when
	debugging memory initialization issues.
	(cmd_memscan): Added -u switch to memscan so that we can update
	the memory map passed to the kernel after APEX has made it's pass
	at initialization time.

2007-02-13  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c: Added Spansion command support to the
	nor-cfi driver.  This is a configuration time option.  Only one
	command set/protocol may be selected at a time.

2007-02-12  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-nand.c: Augmented NAND driver to allow for both
	Toshiba style command and ST style commands.  The ST stuff is
	incomplete, but reading ought to be OK.

2007-02-05  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): 1.4.15, allows a wait of 0 for a check for
	^C before continuing.  Mainly done to release to debian.

2007-02-05    <elf@baker.buici.com>

	* debian/rules: Dumb typo when I revised the rules.  The name of
	the output file changed and I didn't want it to.

2007-02-02  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-wait.c: Allowing a zero TIMEOUT.

	* src/apex/command.c (TIMECMD_INIT): Added command execution timer.

2007-01-31  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* debian/rules: Cross-building support.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/serial.c: Minor change to the ixp42x serial
	driver to raise RTS for the same of systems that use it.

2007-01-30  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/lib/lib1funcs.S: New version of lib1funcs so that
	armel is happy.  This code was pulled directly from the Linux
	kernel source.

2007-01-29  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* Added alternatives to Debian configs.

2007-01-29  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): Rolled rev for block cache fix.

	* src/drivers/drv-ext2.c: inode/block cache flush was broken.
	Now, it is not.

2007-01-27  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* usr/apex-env.8: Man page.

	* usr/link.h: Added cleanup code to Link object.  It isn't
	strictly necessary, but it is good hygiene.

2007-01-27  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* Makefile: 1.4.12 for new environment program and to prepare for
	publishing a new release.

	* usr/apex-env.cc: New user-mode program for updating the APEX
	environment once the system is booted.  It replaces the printenv
	program that was only able to print the environment as it stood,
	combining the flash data with the defaults from APEX.  This
	program is smart enough to be able to set/unset variables and
	erase the whole environment.

2007-01-25  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/clcdc-companion.c: Removed the DDS hack form
	the LCD init on Companion.  No DDS circuit present anymore.

2007-01-23  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/lib/memtest.c (memory_test_0): Revised the memory test
	walking bit loop on advice from a collegue.  Made the full memory
	test an option on top of the basic memory test.

2007-01-23  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/variation-companion.c (variation_init): Added
	variation support to the Companion.  Pressing three keys at
	power-on will activate the variation boot.

2007-01-13  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/reset.c (__section): Slight change to MMU
	disabling code.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/mmu-xscale.h (CACHE_CLEAN_D): Revised cache
	clean code to match Nicolas Pitre's work in the Linux kernel.

2007-01-09  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-fis.c (end_of_table): Added back the
	end-of-table check.  We're now checking the same way that the
	kernel checks.

2007-01-09  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): 1.4.11, to fix partition table swapped-ness
	check.

	* src/drivers/drv-fis.c (prescan_directory): Fixed the partition
	table swapped-ness check to a more robust comparison of the
	partition table entry's erase block with the erase block from
	which the table is being read.

2007-01-08  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* 1.4.10.

	* src/drivers/drv-fis.c (deleted_entry): Replaced the
	end_of_table() checks with deleted_entry checks.  Really, we
	cannot be sure that we've seen the end of the table since a 0xff
	in the first byte indicates a deleted entry and we have to check
	for that first.  We previously thought that (u32)~0 was the end of
	the table, but we cannot now be sure.  Argh.

	* Applyied nas100d and dsmg600 patches as well as a slew of config
	file patches courtesy of rwhitby.

	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c (SWAP_ONE): Fixed the nor flash driver
	to properly write when in an endian mismatched mode.  This may be
	peculiar to the nslu2 (and other ixp4xx systems) where flash is
	assumed to be written in one endian-ness while the system is
	executing in the opposite endian-ness.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/variation-nslu2.c (variation_init): Variation
	now uses the fact that the power button is depressed (instead of
	the reset button).

	* src/lib/dump.c (dumpw): Fixed the printability check on dump so
	that we don't write non-ascii characters.

	* src/lib/env.c (env_check_magic): Streamlined the environment
	magic number check.

2007-01-06  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/apex/env.c: Many more environment variables may be defined.

	* src/apex/cmd-boot.c (atag_commandline): boot command performs
	lookup of the default command line that allows for alternatives.

	* src/arch-arm/Kconfig: Reworking of the environment configuration
	section.  We now have options to set alternative kernel command
	line, kernel source region, and ramdisk region.  Default variation
	suffix is a config parameter.  The default startup command is more
	clearly controlled.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/variation-nslu2.c (variation_init): Added
	variation for nslu2.  Holding the reset button while booting will
	select the alternative boot and set the variation to the
	configured value.

	* src/apex/command.c (expand_variables): Added '-' to the list of
	acceptable characters when scanning a command for variables to
	expand.  This is helpful for variations.

	* src/lib/lookup.c (lookup_alias_or_env): Variation support added
	to the standard lookup function.

2006-12-13  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapsedev.com>

	* src/apex/command.c (parse_command): Added '-' command prefix
	that tells APEX to ignore the return value of a command.  This is
	helpful in the startup command.

2006-11-07  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): Rolling rev for memory test.

	* src/lib/memtest.c (memory_test_0): memory test for system setup.
	It checks SDRAM before copying the loader post-bootstrap.  Works
	generally on any target, but requires that the
	initialize_bootstrap () function return TRUE when it initializes
	SDRAM.

2006-10-25  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-nand.c (cmd_nand): NAND commands moved to a
	configurable option.
	(nand_report): Fixed the display of the NAND status.

2006-10-23  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-fis.c (prescan_directory): Modified the check
	for swapped partitions to compare the address of the directory
	partition with the address being scanned.  Should be more robust
	than the original test.  Also added a further limit to directory
	scanning using the length of the directory partition.

2006-10-23  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/mmu-alloc.c (alloc_uncached_top_retain):
	Function returns a block of memory from the top of scanned RAM.
	It also removes the memory from the pool passed to the kernel.

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-clcdc.c (clcdc_init): New configuration
	option to allocate the frame buffer from the top of memory and
	remove it from the pool given the kernel.  It also prevents the
	LCD display from being shut down when the loader passes control to
	the boot or go application.

2006-10-18  Marc Singer  <elf@zealous.synapse.com>

	* Makefile: v1.4.7

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/preinitialization-companion.c:
	Preinitialization support to work-around limitation in Sharp Boot
	ROM.  The ROM only loads 512 bytes from modern NAND parts.  We
	need to pull more of this down in order to properly initialize the
	system and copy the loader to SDRAM.

	* src/drivers/drv-nand.c: Genericized NAND driver.

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-clcdc.c: New panels.  Reorganized the panel
	setup code to better conform to standard nomenclature.

	* src/drivers/drv-dm9000.c: Support for more than one DM9000
	chip.  It can write to both mac address roms as well.

2006-08-18    <elf@scarlet.buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-fis.c (compare_skips): Fixed the comparison
	function.  The sign sense was wrong and it sorted to the wrong
	order.

2006-08-12    <elf@scarlet.buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): v1.4.3

	* src/drivers/drv-fis.c (fis_report): Added skips to the report.

	* debian/rules: Removed headerization so that slugimage can be
	responsible for it.

	* src/drivers/drv-fis.c: Added skip descriptor handling.  This
	means that partitions may include 'skips' where some data
	physically located in the partition is ignored when performing IO
	on the partition.  This feature was added for the slug with a dumb
	version of Redboot that ignores the partition table when looking
	for the data it must copy to SDRAM.

	* src/apex/cmd-fill.c (cmd_fill): Removed unwanted printf.

	* src/lib/sort.c (sort): Check for degenerate cases of sorting 0
	or 1 element.

	* debian/*: Fixed the control file and and changelog to properly
	reflect this release.

2006-07-30  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): Rolling revision in preparation for release
	of the BSP. apex-1.4.2

	* src/mach-lh7952x/env.c: Moved all lh7952x's to use the
	amba-pl011 serial driver in the kernel.

2006-07-29  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-clcdc.c (clcdc_release): Revised the order of
	the clcdc driver release so it works on the lh79520 which will
	disable the controller clock.

	* src/drivers/drv-cf.c (ready_wait): Recoded ready_wait to use the
	attribute pin replacement register.  This doesn't really have an
	impact on performance, but it does require that the driver is
	properly configured in the drv_cf.h header.

2006-07-27  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-cf.c (cf_identify): Fixed attribute reading for
	some cards that return the value in the high and low bytes.
	Attribute memory is really only byte addressable.  This fixes a
	problem with recognizing some brands of CF cards.

2006-07-25  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* usr/printenv.cc: Rewritten printenv program to support the new
	environment memory format.

	* README_environment: New README about the environment.

	* Makefile: Removed envmagic.h and it's computation.  The new
	environment is free-standing and removal of envmagic makes the
	build much quicker.

2006-07-25  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/lib/env.c (_env_locate): New environment implementation is
	self-contained for both reading and writing.

2006-07-25    <elf@scarlet.buici.com>

	* src/mach-ixp42x/debian-nslu2-arm_config: Moved the start of the
	kernel and ramdisk regions to skip the 16 byte sercomm header.

	* include/atag.h: Fixed atag section macros.

2006-07-23    <elf@scarlet.buici.com>

	* src/mach-ixp42x/cpuinfo.c (cpuinfo_report): Alignment change to
	the cpuinfo function.

	* include/driver.h: Added query function to the driver jump table.

	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c (nor_query): New query function allows
	a driver to return information about the device.  NOR flash is the
	only implementer because it's the one that needs this most.
	(copy_from): Implementation of a byte swapping copy routine for
	the sake of BE/LE conversion.

	* src/drivers/drv-fis.c (prescan_directory): New directory prescan
	detemines if the flash directory has a different endian-ness from
	APEX.
	(map_region): New function to map the directory entry to a
	region.  Now, the region use the underlying flash driver.

	* src/apex/cmd-copy.c (cmd_copy): Added -s option to copy for byte
	swapping data where the source is a different ending from APEX.

2006-07-22    <elf@scarlet.buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-mem.c (memory_read): Checks the width field and
	performs IO accordingly.

	* src/apex/cmd-help.c: Revised command line help.

	* include/driver.h: New descriptor field specifies the IO width.
	This allows, in particular, the memory driver to tailor the I/O to
	a specific width.  Some regions must be read as words (CPU
	registers), others as bytes (CF).

	* src/apex/cmd-dump.c (cmd_dump): Here, and elsewhere, added
	alignment attributes so that byte arrays on the stack are word
	aligned.  I had thought that this was a given but the 4.x
	compilers no longer make this true.

	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c (nor_report): Code to detect endian
	mismatch.  A debugging aid for nslu2.

2006-07-21  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Many: Modified several source files to cope with GCC 4.1.  Found
	a bug detected by GCC's null statement detection.  Mostly warning
	fixes dues to signed/unsigned coercion.

2006-07-20  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile: Release 1.3.30.  Debianized.  New FIS driver.

	* src/apex/command.c (expand_variables): Using new lookup function
	to resolve variable/macro references in command expansion.

	* src/lib/lookup.c: New lookup function to handle checks to
	aliases as well as environment without explicitly including
	ifdefs.

	* src/drivers/drv-jffs2.c (block_driver): Replacing static block
	driver string with a function that looks at aliases and the
	environment.

	* src/drivers/drv-fat.c (block_driver): Replacing static block
	driver string with a function that looks at aliases and the
	environment.

	* src/drivers/drv-ext2.c (block_driver): Replacing static block
	driver string with a function that looks at aliases and the
	environment.

	* src/drivers/drv-fis.c: New FIS partition driver.

2006-07-18  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/reset.c: Added code to support forcing the
	CPU into LITTLEENDIAN mode.  This is necessary for running the
	NSLU2 is LE mode for Debian without replacing the Redboot loader.

2006-07-14  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile: added logic to the build to archive prebuilt binaries
	for each configuration.

2006-07-11  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/reset.c: Fix for register being clobbered in
	apex_relocate() and messing with PUTC_LL().

2006-07-10  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-help.c (cmd_help): Added option to suppress the
	short help descriptions.  It saves a little bit on memory.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: Optimized the RAM memory
	footprint, especially in the xbss section.  Added stack_size
	configuration parameter.

	* src/apex/cmd-boot.c (cmd_boot): Boot address may not come from
	the environment.
	(atag_commandline): Simplified the command line from environment
	code such that there is no code to read from environment when
	there is no environment.

2006-06-02  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile: Release 1.3.28.  Added dm9000 mac address programming.

2006-06-02  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* Makefile: Release 1.3.27.  Version for companion as well.

2006-06-01  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/relocate-companion.c: Fixed the section of the
	relocation function.  Added console feedback for the bootstrap.

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-mmc.c: Added proper configuration checks for
	the companion relocation.

	* Many changes to the environment handling so that the environment
	is present, and usable, even if the commands to manipulate it are
	not.

	* src/apex/cmd-env.c: Fixed a stupid error in the environment
	command code that required the setenv command in order to use the
	printenv command.

2006-05-29  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-ext2.c (ext2_info): Fixed the way that
	partitions are detected so that changing partitions will properly
	flush cached information about the filesystem.

2006-05-28  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): Rolled to 1.3.25 for the MMC driver fixes.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: The bootstrap data location is
	properly calculated.

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-mmc.c: MMC driver can read multiple blocks.
	Well, two to be precise, but at least we know it works.  The
	status returned from wait_for_status it more than 16 bits because
	of the timeout.  All of the reference to status are widened to
	int's to make this easier.
	(execute_command): Default wait_for status is not better tuned to
	the command being executed.  The driver gets a nice, smooth data
	stream from the card.

2006-05-27  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): New sub-level for the companion changes.
	This will roll to a new patchlevel when we get the drivers going
	for sure.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/relocate-companion.c: relocate-apex ()
	implementation for the synapse companion.

	* src/arch-arm/Kconfig: Added more configuration options for
	compiler optimizations.

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-i2c.c: i2c driver for reading/writing
	EEPROM.

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-mmc.c: Mmc driver, SD capable, bootstrap
	capable

	* include/mmc.h: Factored out the mmc header for the sake of
	relocation from SD/MMC.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: Special section for bootstrap
	stack and bootstrap data.

	* include/apex.h: Aide functions for mdelay and msleep.

2006-05-04  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-clcdc.c: Added support for BGR color format
	in the frame buffer.  This is really for the benefit of testing,
	but may also be important when we support a splash screen being
	visible through the kernel boot process.

2006-04-03  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile: 1.3.23
	* Additions to the kconfig directory so that make menuconfig
	works again.

2006-04-01  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile: 1.3.22

	* src/mach-lh7952x/drv-emac.c (cmd_emac): Moved static structure
	to .rodata.

	* src/drivers/drv-smc91x.c (cmd_eth): Moved static structure to
	.rodata.

	* src/apex/command.c (expand_variables): Allowing '\' escape of
	'$' to prevent expansion of variables for the sake of storing them
	in other environment strings, e.g. startup.

	* include/attributes.h: Grooming.

	* src/apex/console.c: Added (optional) command
	editing...finally...no kidding.

2006-03-31  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/console.c (read_command): Added (optional) support for
	ANSI key sequences.

	* src/apex/command-history.c: Added (optional) command history
	recall.

2006-03-30  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7952x/drv-emac.c (emac_release): added a release
	function to the emac driver.  We were having problems with
	spurrious corruption of kernel memory and it looks like the
	problem was that the emac was in an indeterminate state as it was
	being initialized.

2006-03-23  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-version.c (cmd_version): Fixed the presentation of
	the apex region for the case when the length is greater than four
	hex digits.

	* src/apex/console.c (read_command): Configuration option allows
	DEL to be interpreted as BS.

	* Makefile: 1.3.21

	* usr/printenv.cc (main): Application that reads APEX environment
	from user-land.

	* src/apex/env.c: added environment link support so that user-land
	applications can read the APEX environment.

2006-03-22  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-clcdc.c (VSW): Fixed error in the VSW macro.

	* src/drivers/drv-ext2.c (ext2_find_inode): Fixed the computation
	of the first block where the group descriptors are found.  This
	allows APEX to read cards with block sizes other than 1K.

2006-03-16  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/freq: Perl script that aids in finding clock
	frequency dividers.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/Kconfig: Added more overclocking frequencies to
	the lh7a40x configuration.

	* Brought Kconfig sources up to date.

2006-03-15  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile: 1.3.20

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c: Adjusted the SMC controller
	timing setup to be sensitive to HCLK as configured.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/lh7a40x.h: Kconfig selectable operating
	frequencies.

	* Adding support for new architecture, s3c2410, and new machine
	m7200.

2006-03-02  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile: 1.3.19

	* src/mach-lh7952x/lh79524.h (RCPC_CPUCLKPRE_V): Added support for
	faster clocking of the LH79524.  It isn't, yet, compatible with
	the Linux kernel.  However, this may help someone who is looking
	for a little more speed.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c (target_init): Added support for
	the LPD7A404-10, PN 80000258, USB_PWR_EN.  The sense of this line
	changed between the -10 and the -11 releases of the LPD7A404
	CardEngine.

2006-02-23  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile: 1.3.18

	* src/mach-lh7952x/init-lpd79524.c: Tighetened the CF region
	timing as is done for the other targets.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/init-lpd79520.c: Adjusted to the CompactFlash
	region timing to meet the CF spec.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c (SMC_BCR6_V): Tightened the CF
	region timing to be closer to the specified minimums.  The
	original WST1 delay was 320ns which may interfere with the LCD
	controller FIFO.

2006-02-22  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c (SMC_BCR1_V): Tightened the
	IOBARRIER region timing to see if we can get access to NOR flash
	without causing display flicker.

2006-02-17  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/lib/zlib-heap.c (CB_HEAP): Increased the size of the heap so
	I can decompress very large PNG images.

	* Makefile:  1.3.17

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-clcdc.c: New timings for the 6.4" display.
	The vertical front porch is one less than the spec.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c (SDRAM_RAS): Relaxed memory
	timings on the lh7a40x's.  This seems to eliminate display
	glitching as long as we don't use the CF.

2006-02-07  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile: 1.3.16

	* src/mach-lh7952x/init-lpd79524.c: Reworked SDRAM initialization.
	Now, we can init the CPU with a 16 bit SDRAM bus even if the SDRAM
	chips are configured in a 32 bit bus.  Half of the SDRAM will idle
	in this configuration, but we can test CPU performance with the 16
	bit bus.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/cmd-cp15test.c: Added a cp15 test register
	manipulation function.

2006-02-06  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* lh7a404_config: Setting default memory mode to SROM_LL.

2006-01-20  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/lib/pngr.c (read_pngr_plte): When found, a palette is read
	from the PNG file and stored for the decoder.

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-clcdc.c (cmd_splash): Added support for
	palettized images, but only at 8 bits per pel.  Other pel sizes
	require unpacking of the image data.

2006-01-13  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-ixp42x/openslug_config: Openslug 3.1 no longer puts the
	kernel in the jffs2 partition.  We default to reading the kernel
	from flash.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/mmu.c (mmu_release): In order to support
	XScale MMU (and caches) we need to customize the MMU disabling
	code to cope with a different method of cleaning the data cache.
	This is done for the sake of faster loading of a JFFS2 filesystem
	image.  The kernel is stored in a JFFS2 filesystem in flash for
	compactness.  The faster we can read this data, the better.  Also,
	reads from flash of ramdisk images benefits from caching.

2005-12-27  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/lib/relocate.c (relocate_apex): Improved the scarce
	register version of the system copy routine.  It's now using the
	same form as the fastest version.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/cmd-reset.c (cmd_reset): Added reset command
	for the lh7a40x targets.  It used the watchdog timer to perform
	the system reset.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/entry.c (setup_c): Added code for clearing
	stacks to a known value.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/exception_vectors.c: The exception handling
	code works.  APEX can use interrupts.

	* src/arch-arm/lib/relocate.c (relocate_apex) :recoded
	relocation test to reduce the number of registers and to update
	the syntax for __asm constraints.  This code was substantially
	modified to reflect some minor optimizations.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/relocate-nand.c (relocate_apex): recoded
	relocation test to reduce the number of registers and to update
	the syntax for __asm constraints.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c (usleep): recoded timer to
	update the syntax for __asm constraints.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/init-kev79524.c (usleep): recoded timer to
	update the syntax for __asm constraints.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/init-lpd79520.c (usleep): recoded timer to
	update the syntax for __asm constraints.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/init-lnode80.c (usleep): recoded timer to
	update the syntax for __asm constraints.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/init-lpd79524.c (usleep): recoded timer to
	update the syntax for __asm constraints.

2005-12-22  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/lib/pngr.c (open_pngr): Function modified to allow for
	reading from TFTP where we don't know the length of the stream
	a priori.

	* src/net/tftp.c (tftp_seek): Rudimentary seek function
	implemented for the sake of splash decoding.  We needed to be able
	to seek over the CRC (or unused portion of any chunk) in order to
	decode PNG images over the network.

	* src/lib/zlib-heap.c: Makde the zlib heap larger since the
	decompressor was choking on the decode of a large splash image.
	Also moved the memory to xbss.  We're still using a stupid null
	free heap which has to be as large as all of the allocated memory.
	RAM is cheap, at the moment.  Perhaps we should switch to the
	kernel's zlib decompressor instead of the uboot version.

	* src/drivers-lh/drv-clcdc.c: Common LCD driver for Sharp LH
	parts.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/mmu-alloc.c (alloc_uncached): Function to
	allocate memory that won't be cached even when the MMU is enabled.

2005-12-19  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/mmu.c: Service to enable and disable the MMU.
	This makes the boot loader execute much faster than without.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/serial.c (lh7952x_serial_release): Added a
	release function so that serial data in the FIFO is flushed.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/serial.c (lh7a40x_serial_release): Added a
	release function so that serial data in the FIFO is flushed.

2005-12-16  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/lh7a40x.h: Added an overclocking mode.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c: Added more explicit macros to
	handle bus clocking modes.  Also, we've switched to the
	synchronous bus mode as the default.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/lh7a40x.h: Added more explicit macros to handle
	bus clocking modes.

	* src/drivers/drv-mem.c: Added memlimit command so that we can
	constrain the amount of memory that the Linux kernel sees.  It's a
	handy debug feature.

2005-11-18  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c: Added option to inhibit the NOR CFI
	buffered write code, for lnode80.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/Kconfig: Added lnode80, patch from Dave Anders.

2005-11-07  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* Makefile: Rolling release for 79525 and for a fix to the
	emac79524 driver.

2005-10-08  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/net/ethernet.c (arp_terminate): Added a check for ^C in the
	ARP termination function.

	* src/net/tftp.c (tftp_open): Reorganized the tftp open sequence
	in case ARP for the TFTP server has yet to be achieved.  This was
	a crash bug.

2005-10-07  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7952x/Kconfig: Start of changes for the kev79525.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: Fixed the drv-mem probe code to
	be reliable and safe.

2005-09-30  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c: Slowed the timing down for the
	IOBARRIER.  Now, we're using the slowest timing because that's all
	that seems to work.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/sdramboot.c (sdramboot_report): Unified
	support for reporting when APEX is booted from SDRAM.  While only
	informational, this will help explain to new users the difference
	between booting from flash or SRAM and from SDRAM.

2005-09-29  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/env.c: Updated autoboot cancellation message to be more
	correct.  Only ^C cancels now.

2005-09-28  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/Makefile: architecture and tune features.  This
	fixes a build problem with native compilers.

	* src/arch-arm/Kconfig: New configuration features to select the
	right architecture.  Lack of this was the source of a nasty build
	error having to do with the fact that the default CPU type on ARM
	doesn't support the half-word load.

2005-09-27  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: Enlarged the stacks.  We were
	crashing from a stack overflow in the jffs2 decompression path.

	* src/lib/zlib.c: Changes so that we can use the debug option.

	* src/drivers/drv-jffs2.c (jffs2_load_cache): Fixed bug in jffs2
	filesystem cache.  Cancelled cache operation which was restarted
	would create duplicate entries in the cache.

2005-09-18  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* include/attributes.h (__xbss): New attribute macro for easy xbss
	spec.

2005-09-15  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/lib/env.c (_env_check_magic): Modified the environment check
	before writing to look for a large block of 0xff's before
	declaring the area blank.

2005-09-02  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: Needed to set the xbss section to
	NOLOAD so that the loader image wouldn't bloat with BSS areas

2005-08-22  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: Reorganized the BSS sections.
	Needed to put the BSS outside of the protected region so that the
	memory scan finds all of memory correctly.  This change also
	prevents some of the BSS memory from being zeroed.

2005-08-15  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c (target_init): Modified the target
	init for lpd7a404 so that the SMC91x controller works properly on
	the latest lpd7a404 CardEngines; PCN-285 2005.5.4.

2005-08-11  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/lpd7a40x.h (CPLD_CONTROL_WLPEN): Changed
	constant name to match that used by the driver and the LPD79520.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/timer.c (timer_delta): The interval timer was
	wrong, too.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c: The usleep timer setup was wrong.
	Don't know how this ever worked.  ;-) Had to move it to timer2 so
	that it didn't conflict with the interval timer.

2005-08-10  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-mem.c (memory_report): Groomed the memory report
	to eliminate first blank line.

	* src/apex/command.c (exec_monitor): Removed leading whitespace in
	startup command reports.

2005-08-08  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-copy.c (cmd_copy): Detecting copy errors and
	returning appropriate error code.

	* src/apex/command.c (exec_monitor): Fixed parser for startup
	command so that semicolon no longer needed at the end of the
	command.  Fixed a bug in the routine that writes to address zero
	on startup.

	* src/apex/console.c (console_poll): Improved methods for
	detecting user break condition.  Injected a meta-driver between
	the serial driver and the functions that communicate with the
	user.

2005-08-03  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7952x/ads7843.c: ads7843 test command.

2005-08-01  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/net/ipconfig.c (cmd_ipconfig): IP configuration via RARP or
	manual configuration.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/drv-emac.c (cmd_emac): Some grooming of the
	diagnostic outputs.

	* src/net/tftp.c (ping_terminate): Fixed abort of tftp by
	keystroke.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/drv-emac.c (eth_read): Check for buffer looping
	on read.  This is untested.

2005-07-29  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/net/tftp.c: fixed the tftp state machine and tested that
	retries work correctly.   it seems to be stable and reliable in
	light of packet losses.

	* src/apex/cmd-copy.c (cmd_copy): Fixed a long-standing bug in the
	copy command where the din descriptor was being opened twice.

2005-07-28  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-smc91x.c: Implemented smc91x driver which is
	available to both the lpd79520 and the lpd7a40x boards.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/init-lpd79520.c: Fixed the initialization of
	the memory region where CF is found.  CF driver working again.

2005-07-11  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-dump.c (cmd_dump): Added dump display width to make
	it easier to read registers and machine code.

2005-07-07  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/net/rarp.c (cmd_rarp): RARP implemented.

	* src/apex/cmd-help.c (cmd_help): Changed the way that commands
	are sorted such that there is no change to the R/O portion of the
	file.  Now, sorting is done only when displaying the help text.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/drv-emac.c (eth_open): Basis of ethernet driver
	is working.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: Neglected alignment caused a
	crash when the data segment wasn't aligned.  The service data was
	misaligned such that the service start addresses were wrong.

2005-07-06  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-dump.c (cmd_dump): Added more mode to the dump
	command.

	* src/apex/command.c (expand_variables): Alias and environment
	expansion in the command line.  This will make some people's lives
	easier.

2005-06-15  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/command.c (exec_monitor): Adding configuration option
	to sort commands for the sake of better help.

	* src/apex/cmd-xreceive.c: Revising help text.

2005-06-14  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/driver.c (parse_descriptor): Fixed the driver parser
	dependency on the filesystem drivers.

	* src/drivers/drv-fat.c (fat_read): Region length calc, again.

	* src/drivers/drv-ext2.c (ext2_read): Fixed the region length
	calcs.

	* src/drivers/drv-jffs2.c (jffs2_open): Fixed some of the region
	length calcs.

2005-06-13  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-jffs2.c (jffs2_path_to_inode): Needed to
	invalidate the cached block after chasing links.
	(find_cached_inode): Enhanced find_cached_inode() to accept an
	offset within the file.  This may improve the performance of
	reading since it doesn't have to scan the inode list from the top
	every time.  Moreover, the algorithm of the find_cached_inode
	function is more efficient for larget files.
	(jffs2_load_cache): Changed the logic for handling reversed
	markers.  The previous code would prematurely terminate if a
	reversed marker was found among the filesystem detritus.
	(jffs2_load_cache): Added a CRC check for inodes.
	(jffs2_path_to_inode): Added a CRC check for filenames.

2005-06-12  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/cmd-info.c: New command to query information about a
	region from a driver.  It's used by the jffs2 driver to show the
	contents of a directory.  Other filesystems ought to follow suit.

	* src/drivers/drv-jffs2.c: New jffs2 reading filesystem driver.

2005-05-15  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-ixp42x/pci.c (pci_init): Added IRQ setup for all of the
	PCI interrupt pins.

2005-05-15  Marc Singer  <elf@cerise.buici.com>

	* src/lib/spinner.c (spinner_clear): clearing LED spinner when the
	user enters a command prompt.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/pci.c (pci_init): Proper PCI initialization
	brings USB and ethernet online.  Woot.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/nslu2.h: GPIO constants and macros for init.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/ixp42x.h: GPIO constants and macros for init.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/initialize.c (target_init): Addition of dead
	code to initialize GPIO for the Intel dev board.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/serial.c (ixp42x_serial_init): Enabled the
	serial FIFO.

2005-05-04  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7952x/drv-emac.c: Diagnostic code can be enabled from
	the configuration.

	* src/apex/cmd-version.c (cmd_version): Display the length of apex
	in bytes as well as hex.

2005-04-14  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/Kconfig: New option to let the user configure a
	default commandline to override the target's default.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/initialize.c (target_init): Added neglected EXP
	controller initializations for the nslu2.

2005-04-13  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-ext2.c: Added configuration option to set the
	block device for both (fat & ext2) filesystem drivers.

	* src/apex/env.c: Fixed errors in the autoboot macros left over
	from the transition to Kconfig.

2005-04-08  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7952x/drv-emac.c (emac_init): Fixed detection of the
	PHY.  Needed to setup MUX to get the PHY to enable.

	* src/mach-ixp42x/coprocessor.h (COPROCESSOR_WAIT\): New headers
	to define an instruction sequence to let the MMU/coprocessor catch
	up when there are changes to the setup.

	* src/arch-arm/entry/entry.c (__section): New options for
	disabling MMU at startup.

	* Makefile (every): Fixed every target for the sake of adding new
	configuration options.

2005-04-07  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7952x/Makefile (obj-$(CONFIG_DRIVER_EMAC_LH79524)):
	Same as below.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/drv-emac.c: Corrected configuration references
	for the new configurator.  Macros were wrong for EMAC.

2005-03-22  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/apex/env.c (_s): Fixed references to CONFIG_ macros that may
	already be quoted.

2005-03-20  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c (__section): initializing the SMC
	control so that flash works correctly.

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): Fixed the reset of the config hooks so that
	the build is now optimal with respect to the configuration.

	* Fixed menuconfig.  Still, I've never been able to edit strings,
	hex's, or int's in menuconfig. It's there for the folks who want it.

	* Makefile (SUBLEVEL): Rolling revision for integration of new
	configuration support.  This is a big deal because it means that
	configurations are easier to build and more robust.

	* scripts/configtoh: Stripping the quotes from config options.
	We're using the kernel configurator, so we have less control over
	the user's actions.  This may prove to be overly zealous in
	situations where the configuration option needs quotes.
	...Now it is really fixed.  Needed it and there was no way around it.

2005-03-17  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/cpuinfo.c (cpuinfo_report): Fixed the CPUID
	reporting for the lh7a404.

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c: Added hack to the lpd7a40x
	initialization to enable PCMCIA.  May be a work-around for a NOR
	flash problem.

	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c (nor_read): Eliminated (most)
	references to nor chip length except when necessary.

2005-03-16  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7952x/timer-lh79520.c (lh79520_timer_init): Fixed the
	initialization of the boot loader timer.

	* src/mach-lh7952x/lpd79520_config (CONFIG_NOR_BANK0_START): Fixed
	the starting address of the NOR flash so that the REMAP register
	doesn't make a difference.

	* src/apex/cmd-boot.c: Making sure that the ATAG pointer is valid.

2005-03-15  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/arch-arm/entry/apex.lds.S: Added new START identifier for
	the sake of the memory scan function.

	* src/drivers/drv-mem.c (memory_scan): The memory scan function
	needed to make sure not to write to BSS.  It now avoids the entire
	memory image of APEX.

2005-03-10  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/mach-lh7a40x/initialize.c: SDRAM initialization was
	completely broken since 1.1.0.  It works again.

	* src/drivers/drv-cf.c: Moved Compact Flash code to live among
	generic drivers.  Implemented CF for the 79520's.  Wrote code for
	the 7a40x's, but it isn't working.

	* src/drivers/drv-ext2.c (ext2_path_to_inode): Fixed dumb error in
	the symlink traversal code.

	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c: Improved TALK for troubleshooting
	flash.

2005-03-09  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-nor-cfi.c: Moved the cfi driver into the generic
	driver directory.  There is a machine specific header to handle
	the target controlled constants.

	* Makefile (ENV_CROSS_COMPILE): Fixed the selection of the cross
	compiler so that the environment will override the configured
	value.

2005-03-07  Marc Singer  <elf@buici.com>

	* src/drivers/drv-ext2.c: ext2 driver is working.  It supports
	paths and following symlinks.

	* scripts/envmagic: Grooming.  Properly fixed.
