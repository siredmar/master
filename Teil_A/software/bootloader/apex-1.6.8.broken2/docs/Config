===========================
     APEX Boot Loader
         Config
===========================

The descriptions in this file are superceeded by the help strings in
the config scripts.  Configuration of APEX is now done with one of the
configuration programs, just like the Linux kernel 2.6.

The defaults in the Kconfig files may be overriden by user selected
values.  The safest way to create a new configuration is to remove the
.config file and start from scratch.
