===========================
     APEX Boot Loader
       Variations
===========================

This README gives background and some guidance for implementing and
using variations.

  Overview
  --------

Variations were added to APEX to facilitate alternative booting
methods.  It is common to want a secondary boot process that is
activated by some sort of user action or system state.  The specifics
of how these secondary processes is selected is specific to a target
or build of APEX, but the mechanism should be the same in all cases.

By defining an environment variable or alias of the name 'variation',
APEX will select alternative versions of environment variables or
aliases when available when expanding them on the command line or when
variables are referenced by drivers.  When 'variation' is set to
'_alt', APEX will first look for the startup command in 'startup_alt'
and then in 'startup' if the variation is not present.  This is true
for all variable references include the ones used to define the base
regions for drivers.

  Implementation
  --------------

Most targets will want to detect the variation from a runtime source,
e.g. a button being pressed while power is applied.  The easiest
method for performing this check is within a service.  Care must be
taken to execute the variation service after critical system services
are available such as timers.  Generally, it should be safe to
implement the variation service last.

  Environment Variables vs. Aliases
  ---------------------------------

Runtime selection of the variation requires that aliases be
configured.  Remember, the difference between environment variables
and aliases is that environment variables are immediately saved to
non-volatile storage when set and aliases are only stored in RAM

  _alt vs. -alt
  -------------

While both are perfectly valid and the environment variable expansion
code supports both, it is important to be aware that variable and
alias names will only expand with alphanumeric names with - and _
added to aid readability.

  ====================

static void variation_init (void)
{
  if (is_reset_button_pressed ())
    alias_set ("variation", "_alt"); 
}

static __service_9 struct service_d variation_service = {
  .init = variation_init,
};
