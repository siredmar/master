===========================
     APEX Boot Loader
         Network
===========================

There is some support for networking in APEX.  Where there are
Ethernet drivers, support exists for RARP and TFTP as well as ICMP
ping.

The UDP code does not generate checksums by default.  Reportedly, this
may cause problems with some inet daemons.  The UDP code sets the
checksum to zero to indicate that there is no checksum.  If the TFTP
requests are being ignored, try a different daemon or eliminate the
inetd startup for the daemon.
