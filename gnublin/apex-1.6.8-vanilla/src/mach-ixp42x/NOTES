NPE/MAC Implementation

  There is good code from the Christian Hohnstaedt in the form of a
  kernel driver for 2.6.19.

  o Do we need to use interrupts?  Can we probe for the interupt status?
  o Firmware download/upload may be the place to start.
  o It's 2500 lines, even in this form.  It may be a challenge to test.
  o The smc91x driver is 1000 lines.
  o We may be able to get a leg up by starting with FW and moving to
    the PHY.  At that point, it may be reasonable to get the queue
    manager working and then the mac and npe code.
  o Need to look at the different kernel modules and the component
    source files for guidance.
  o Need to see how the initialization process runs so that we can
    know which code is required in which order.  Documentation of this
    will be helpful for getting the whole job done.
  o ixmax_open has code to check for the presence of the firmware.
    This will be helpful in determining when and where the firmware is
    loaded.
