===========================
     APEX Boot Loader
	Building 
===========================

This README contains some notes about the build process.


  Recursing Directories
  ---------------------

One of the scripts, envmagic, recurses all of the files in the tree
before building the project.  Since we allow code to be imported into
APEX, built and linked with the loader, we don't want the normal build
scripts to descend these potentially deep directory structures.
Moreover, source control files may also tend to impact the speed of
the build.

So, the envmagic script and other components of the build process will
ignore directories that are called .svn or begin with an underscore.
It also ignores files that begin with '.#' which are created by emacs.
