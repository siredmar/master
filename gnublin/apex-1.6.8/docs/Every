===========================
     APEX Boot Loader
     Prebuilt Binaries
===========================

This README is included in the prebuilt APEX binary archives.

The files in this archive are build for the version of APEX
indentified by the APEXVERSION file.  The configuration file, config,
is the one used to build these files.

  apex.bin	- binary dump of APEX
  apex.elf	- stripped ELF executable
  apex.srec	- SREC text format

The ELF and SREC format files are defined to put the loader at it's
final VMA in SDRAM.  However, APEX may be loaded at any address and
executed there.  The binary format file may be written directly to
flash, SRAM, or SDRAM and executed there.

For more information about loading APEX onto your target, refer to
