   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   Hardware initializations.  Some initialization may be left to
   drivers, such as the serial interface initialization.

   o Size.  The setup for the MX31 is substantially more verbose than
     other platforms we've handled.  With OneNAND boot, there is only
     1K of code available before we can relocate to SDRAM.  The
     solution has been complex.  It has involved restructuring of the
     sections and breaking the relocation into two phases.

   o UART initialization.  Again, because of the large size of MX31
     initialization code, we cannot fit the UART initialization into
     the .bootstrap_pre section and have enough room for the early
     relocation to fit in 512 bytes (the amount of code available from
     OneNAND when we come out of reset).  So, we leave it out for now.
     We could do some sort of low-speed setup of the CPU clock speed
     and *maybe* get the UART clock to work correctly, but this is all
     to serve a very small window of UART output in the early
     relocation.  Blah.

   o According to Micron, Mobile DDR SDRAM initialization requires:

     1. To prevent device latch-up, the core power (VDD) and I/O power
     	(VDDQ) must be brought up simultaneously. It is recommended
     	that VDD and VDDQ be from the same power source or VDDQ must
     	never exceed VDD. Assert and hold CKE HIGH.
     2. Once power supply voltages are stable and the CKE has been
     	driven HIGH, it is safe to apply the clock.
     3. Once the clock is stable, a 200Î¼s (minimum) delay is required
     	by the Mobile DDR SDRAM prior to applying an executable
     	command. During this time, NOP or DESELECT commands must be
     	issued on the command bus.
     4. Issue a PRECHARGE ALL command.
     5. Issue NOP or DESELECT commands for at least tRP time.
     6. Issue an AUTO REFRESH command followed by NOP or DESELECT
     	commands for at least tRFC time. Issue a second AUTO REFRESH
     	command followed by NOP or DESELECT commands for at least tRFC
     	time. As part of the initialization sequence, two AUTO REFRESH
     	commands must be issued. Typically, both of these commands are
     	issued at this stage as described above. Alternately, the
     	second AUTO REFRESH command and NOP or DESELECT sequence can
     	be issued after step 10.
     7. Using the LOAD MODE REGISTER command, load the standard mode
     	register as desired.
     8. Issue NOP or DESELECT commands for at least tMRD time.
     9. Using the LOAD MODE REGISTER command, load the extended mode
     	register to the desired operating modes. Note that the
     	sequence in which the standard and extended mode registers are
     	programmed is not critical.
    10. Issue NOP or DESELECT commands for at least tMRD time.

  o Memory size detection.  We support 512Mib (V2) and 1Gib (V1)
    configurations.  We determine which we have by initializing the
    1Gib mode first and checking that writes to a particular address
    are not being reflected in the a different address.  In our case,
    the difference is 0x800 bytes.  If the addressing is OK, a write
    to 0x80000800 will not appear at address 0x80000000.

  o Refresh timer.  The value of the refresh timer is based on the
    number of rows.  A 13 row part must refresh 8192 rows.  To do this
    in 64ms (typical), the timer should be 7.81us.

  o PRECHARGE and MODE SET commands.  Normally, the address sent to
    the SDRAM would be shifted to account for the width of the memory
    devices.  However, The PRECHARGE and MODE SET commands disable
    this shifting.  Thus, to drive A10 the address bit use an address
    or'd with 0x0400.  The mode register value need not be shifted.

  o Extended Mode.  Setting the extended mode requires setting the
    BA[1:0] bits to binary 10.  The placement of these bits in the
    address register is dependendent on the organization of the memory
    array.  Our best estimate, at the moment, is that the table 19-30
    of the reference manual gives the correct offset.  It is hard to
    tell of this is really the case for setting the mode because the
    secont 19.4.3 states that no address multiplexing occurs while
    setting the mode.  Thus, the bit index could be one or two fewer
    than the value determined from the table.  Note that the
    calculation below is for the configured organization regardless of
    the configuration of the memory chips.

    Calculate the memory size: 2^(rows+cols)*(width/2).

      Memory Size	Address line for BA0
    ----------------------------------------
    8MB   (64Mib)		A21
    16MB  (128Mib)		A22
    32MB  (256Mib)		A23
    64MB  (512Mib)		A24
    128MB (1Gib)		A25
    ----------------------------------------

  o ESDCTL_CFG.  An incorrect value for this register has been known
    to prevent proper operation of the system.  The symptom was that
    IO with SDRAM would sometimes return invalid results.  The CFG
    value doesn't have to be exactly and precisely correct in that the
    values for the MT46H32M32LF (1Gib) work for the MT46H16M32LF
    (512Mib).  Just be sure that the timings are close to correct and
    you should be OK.
