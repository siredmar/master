* NXP PNX I2C Controller

Required properties:

 - reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device
 - compatible: should be "nxp,pnx-i2c"
 - interrupts: <a b> where a is the interrupt number and b is a
   field that represents an encoding of the sense and level
   information for the interrupt
 - interrupt-parent: the phandle for the interrupt controller that
   services interrupts for this device.

Optional properties:

 - clock-frequency: desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz, Default: 100000
 - pnx,timeout: I2C bus timeout in milliseconds, Default: 10
 - slave-addr: Address used by the controller, Hardware default: 110

Examples:

	i2c1: i2c@400A0000 {
		compatible = "nxp,pnx-i2c";
		reg = <0x400A0000 0x100>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mic>;
		interrupts = <51 0>;
	};

	i2c2: i2c@400A8000 {
		compatible = "nxp,pnx-i2c";
		reg = <0x400A8000 0x100>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mic>;
		interrupts = <50 0>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
		pnx,timeout = <100>;
		slave-addr = <111>;
	};
